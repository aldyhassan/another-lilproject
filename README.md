Analysis of Review Scores and Sentiments

Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset containing review scores, sentiments, and related information. The primary objective is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract valuable insights. The dataset includes columns such as originalScore, scoreSentiment, reviewState, and creationDate.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data underwent extensive cleaning to address missing values, correct typos, and standardize formats. Steps included:

Handling missing values in the originalScore column.
Standardizing mixed formats in scores (e.g., "3.5 / 5" to "3.5/5").
Converting letter grades to numeric scores and vice versa for consistent analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA involved several analyses and visualizations:

Score Sentiment Analysis: Distribution of positive and negative score sentiments.
Fixed Score Distribution: Frequency of fixed scores visualized using bar plots.
Handling 'None' Scores: Analysis of sentiment distribution for 'None' scores.
Review State: Distribution of review states visualized using pie charts.
Creation Date Range: Timeline of review creation dates.
Sentiment and Fixed Score Relationship: Relationship between score sentiment and fixed scores.

Insights and Findings
Key findings from the analysis include:

Dominance of positive sentiments in review scores.
Common score values and their distribution.
Patterns in review states and creation dates.
Identification of outliers and interesting observations.

Future Work and Recommendations
Further analyses could include:

Deeper sentiment analysis.
Correlation studies between different features.
Predictive modeling for score sentiments.
Enhanced data collection and preprocessing for improved analysis quality.
